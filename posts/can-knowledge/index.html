<p>The CAN knowledge pages provide technical information on all three CAN (Controller Area Network) data link layer
generations:</p>

</ul>
<p>The CAN knowledge pages also describes several <a href="https://www.can-cia.org/en/can-knowledge/can/systemdesign-can-physicallayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAN physical layer options</a>. Additionally, these pages also contain technical descriptions about classic <a href="https://www.can-cia.org/en/canopen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CANopen</a> and <a href="https://www.can-cia.org/en/can-knowledge/canopen-fd/canopen-fd-the-art-of-embedded-networking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CANopen FD</a> as well as other standardized CAN-based higher-layers.</p>
<p>According to the Open System Interconnection (OSI) seven-layer and the CAN lower-layer model, the CAN lower layers
cover some functions of the transport layer (e.g. automatic retransmission of faulty frames), the data link layer
(DLL), and the physical coding sub-layer (PCS) as well as the physical medium attachment (PMA) sub-layer. The
medium-dependent interface sub-layer is generally application-specific.</p>

<p>The other layers are usually referenced as higher-layer protocols (HLP). Often, the CAN-based application layer
approaches include functional elements of other higher layers (e.g. session, presentation, transport, or network
layers), too. Some of them are accompanied by parameter (data) specifications, which are not in the scope of the OSI
model.</p>
<p>Higher-layer protocols described in the CAN knowledge pages include, in particular, the classic CANopen application
layer (CiA 301) and the CANopen FD application layer (CiA 1301) as well as the related device, interface, and
application profiles. Additionally, some basic information on other CAN-based higher-layer protocols such as
Devicenet, Isobus (ISO 11783), ISO 11992 series, and SAE J1939 series) is provided.</p>

         alt="Figure 3: The CAN PMA sub-layer is normally implemented in CAN transceiver chips as specified in ISO 11898-2 and in CiA 601-4 respectively CiA 610-3 when featuring signal improvement capability"/><figcaption>

</figure>

<p>There are several CAN physical media attachment (PMA) sub-layers standardized. They are normally implemented by
means of transceivers. Most common is the CAN high-speed transceiver. This includes variants supporting bit-rates up
to 1 Mbit/s and those providing tighter symmetry features suitable for higher bit-rates depending on the network
design (CAN FD transceiver). The CAN SIC (signal improvement capability) transceiver are able to suppress ringing on
the network lines. They are specified in CiA 601-4 and CiA 610-3 (supporting PWM coding/decoding).</p>
<p>Most of the CAN physical layer options use twisted-pair copper cable with common ground usually realizes the
physical transmission. Of course, all connected nodes need to support the same bit-rate(s) and the same bit-timing
settings.</p>
<p>The physical medium attachment (PMA) options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.can-cia.org/en/can-knowledge/can/high-speed-transmission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAN high-speed transceiver</a> with optional low-power and optional selective wake-up capability (<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/67244.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISO 11898-2:2016</a>)</li>
<li>CAN SIC (signal improvement capability) transceiver (<a href="https://www.can-cia.org/en/can-knowledge/can/cia601/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CiA 601-4</a>)</li>
<li>CAN XL SIC transceiver (CiA 610-3)</li>
<li>CAN low-power/fault-tolerant transceiver (<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/36055.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISO 11898-3:2006</a>)</li>
<li>CAN truck/trailer transceiver (<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/68376.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISO 11992-1</a>)</li>
<li>Single-wire CAN (SWC) transceiver (<a href="https://www.can-cia.org/en/can-knowledge/can/sae-j2411-single-wire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAE J2411</a>) – not more recommended for new designs</li>
</ul>
<p>Most common is a high-speed transmission up to 1 Mbit/s. This is realized by means of CAN high-speed transceivers
(term recommended by CiA). These transceivers are optionally available with low-power capability and selective
wake-up functionality for partial networking. They are all standardized in ISO 11898-2:2016. Nowadays, this standard
includes the legacy ISO 11898-5 and ISO 11898-6 norms, too.</p>
<p>The robustness of high-speed CAN networks is excellent. In-vehicle networks often use star-topologies, sometimes
with multiple stars. In some applications, hybrid topologies are implemented, combining line and star topology
elements. However, the most robust topology is a bus-line with very short stubs.</p>
<p>For bit-rates higher than 1 Mbit/s as used in the CAN FD data-phase, the CAN high-speed transceivers with improved
symmetry features are used. They are also standardized in ISO 11898-2:2016. There are two versions specified: one
with improved parameters suitable for bit-rates up 2 Mbit/s and another one with even better parameters suitable for
bit-rates up to 5 Mbit/s. Of course, the achievable bit-rate depends highly on the physical network design. This
includes topology, selected cables and connectors, etc. Additionally, CiA has specified the CAN SIC (signal
improvement capability) transceivers, which can suppress ringing (CiA 601-4). This gives network designers more
margin for asymmetries, which can be caused by not optimized network topologies. The CAN SIC XL transceivers
featuring an optional PWM (pulse-width modulation) coding are specified in CiA 610-3. They support bit-rates of up
to 10 Mbit/s and more depending on the network topology and selected electromechanical components (e.g. cables,
connectors, and additional circuitry).</p>
<p>The other physical layer standard used in the automotive industry is ISO 11898-3, a so-called fault-tolerant,
low-power transmission. It is not widely used in other industries, and it is limited to 125 kbit/s. An
application-specific physical layer is standardized in ISO 11992-1, which is also limited to 125 kbit/s. It is used
in truck-trailer point-to-point networks. The single-wire transmission as specified in SAE J2411 has some
restrictions regarding the robustness and the transmission rate. It is not widely implemented.</p>
<p>Other medias are also in use: Fiber-optical and power-line transmissions, for example. However, their specifications
are proprietary.</p>

    <a href="#can-data-link-layers-three-generations" class="header-mark"></a>CAN data link layers: Three generations</h2><p>There are three CAN data link layer generations:</p>

</ul>
<p>The Classical CAN and the CAN FD protocols are internationally standardized in ISO 11898-1. The CAN XL protocol is
specified in CiA 610-1.</p>

<p>CAN is a very reliable producer/consumer serial bus system with multi-drop capabilities. The network arbitration
method is the same for all CAN generations: Classical CAN, CAN FD, and CAN XL. The CAN frames are broadcasted. This
means every node is able to consume any frame produced by any other node in the CAN network.</p>
<p>All three generations use the same non-destructive bus-arbitration method. They support standardized data frame
formats as well as error and overload frames. Remote frames are only featured by Classical CAN.</p>
<p>Originally, CAN was developed for use as an in-vehicle network in passenger cars, nowadays CAN is used in many other
industries. This includes applications in any kind of transportation system (rail vehicle, aircraft, marine, etc.),
in industrial machine control systems, in home and building automation (e.g. HVAC, elevators), in mobile machines
(construction and agriculture equipment), in medical devices and laboratory automation, as well as in many other
embedded and deeply embedded applications. Each year, more than two billion CAN nodes are sold. The price for CAN
protocol controllers is very reasonable.</p>
<p>In the beginning, there was only the data link layer protocol, what we today name Classical CAN. Introduced by Bosch
as CAN 2.0 A/B, it has been internationally standardized in the ISO 11898 series since 1993. CiA doesn’t use the
term CAN 2.0 anymore: we name it Classical CAN.</p>
<p>In 2012, Bosch and other CAN experts improved the CAN protocol to what is known as the CAN FD protocol. The
Classical CAN and CAN FD protocols are by some means backward compatible: Any CAN FD-compliant node understands
Classical CAN frames. However, legacy Classical CAN nodes not supporting CAN FD destroy a received CAN FD frame by
sending an error frame.</p>
<p>Both protocols, Classical CAN and CAN FD are internationally standardized in ISO 11898-1:2015 and feature a high
reliability. All single-bit failures are detectable. Multi-bit failures are found with a very high probability. One
of the unique features is the fault confinement, which provides a network-wide data consistency.</p>
<p>The third CAN protocol generation, called CAN XL, has been developed by CiA technical groups. It provides a lot of
new features including the separation of bus access arbitration (11-bit priority ID) and data frame content
indication (32-bit acceptance field) as well as layer management information (e.g. SDT field). The data field length
ranges from 1 byte to 2048 byte. The CAN XL data link layer is specified in CiA 610-1.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.can-cia.org/en/canopen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CANopen (CiA 301)</a> based on Classical CAN for general embedded real-time control</li>
<li><a href="https://www.can-cia.org/en/can-knowledge/canopen-fd/canopen-fd-the-art-of-embedded-networking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CANopen FD</a> (CiA 1301) based on CAN FD and CAN XL for embedded real-time control with advanced features</li>
<li><a href="https://www.can-cia.org/en/can-knowledge/j1939/j1939-profile-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">J1939 application profiles</a> based on Classical CAN and CAN FD for different domains</li>
<li><a href="https://www.can-cia.org/en/can-knowledge/hlp/devicenet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Devicenet</a> profile based on Classical CAN for factory automation</li>
</ul>
<p>The most generic higher-layer approach is CANopen. It comprises the CiA 301 application layer standardized,
internationally standardized in EN 50325-4, as well as several device, interface, and application profiles (CiA 4xx
series). There are also other protocol specifications for additional communication functions (CiA 3xx series).
CANopen is used in many embedded and deeply embedded control applications.</p>
<p>To provide the broad range of CANopen users the possibility of making use of the advantages offered by CAN FD, CiA
has released the CiA 1301 <a href="https://www.can-cia.org/en/can-knowledge/canopen-fd/canopen-fd-the-art-of-embedded-networking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CANopen FD</a> specification. Due to lengthened <a href="https://www.can-cia.org/en/can-knowledge/canopen-fd/pdo-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDO</a>s, CANopen FD enables the transmission of
more complex process data together with further application data, e.g. relevant for condition monitoring or
authentication purposes. The newly introduced Universal Service Data Object (USDO) enables meeting all communication
requirements, todays and future embedded networks may be faced with. The <a href="https://www.can-cia.org/en/can-knowledge/canopen-fd/usdo-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USDO</a> enables accessing any CANopen FD
device by read- and write-access. In unicast or broadcast, any size of data can be transferred in a way that is
optimized with regard to the size of the transferred data, e.g. by means of expedited, segmented or bulk transfer.
The updated extended EMCY write protocol supports comprehensive diagnosis, e.g. by providing more detailed error
information and a time stamp. Especially with regard to the CANopen FD network-management-related services and the
internal CANopen FD device architecture, CANopen FD keeps the attributes of CANopen, so that users of CANopen can
easily transfer from classic CANopen to CANopen FD.</p>
<p>The family of J1939-based application profiles is another higher-layer approach based on CAN lower layers. The
original J1939 specifications were designed for in-vehicle networks in trucks and buses. The international Society
of Automotive Engineers (SAE) develops and maintains these recommended practices. This specification series includes
the J1939/21 document specifying the mapping to Classical CAN and the J1939/22 document for CAN FD mapping.</p>
<p>The internationally standardized ISO 11783 series (also known as Isobus), one of the J1939 derivatives, is dedicated
for the communication between agriculture tractors and implements such as harvesters. It can also be used for
forestry mobile machines. The IEC 61162-3 (also known as NMEA 2000) is another J1939 derivate; it is optimized for
CAN-based marine navigation networks. The ISO 11992 series standardizes the communication between trucks and
trailers. This J1939 derivate is a base for the European regulation of towed vehicles. Also, the ISO 16844 series
standardizing tachographs uses J1939 messages for some purposes.</p>
<p>DIN has standardized the body builder network profile for commercial vehicles (DIN 4630). It can be mapped to J1939
or classic CANopen. This standard specifies also a generic gateway to in-vehicle networks, which is extended by DIN
14704 for fire-fighting specific functions. There is also a CANopen-based body builder sub-network for fire-fighting
equipment standardized (DIN 14700).</p>
<p>In the passenger car industry, application layers are in general proprietary. Exceptions are the CAN transport layer
and the diagnostic services, which are internationally standardized in ISO 15765-2 (transport and network layer)
respectively in the ISO 14229-2 (unified diagnostic services (UDS) on CAN). Another exception is an open network for
add-on devices, which is specified in the <a href="https://www.can-cia.org/en/can-knowledge/canopen/cia447/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CiA 447</a> CANopen application profile series.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.can-cia.org/en/can-knowledge/hlp/devicenet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Devicenet</a> is a further CAN-based higher-layer protocol. It was originally developed with special regard to factory
automation. It comprises a broad set of profile specifications. Devicenet is internationally standardized in IEC
62026-3. The ODVA nonprofit association maintains this standard and the related profiles.</p>
